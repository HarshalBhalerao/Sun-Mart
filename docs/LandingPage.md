# Landing Page
Simple Landing Page with Spline Animated 3D rotating Earth.

## Components
- Spline Animation 3D Earth
- Navbar (I will discuss about this component here.)
- Dark/Light Mode (Same with this one as well)
- Sidebar (Same as well)

### Spline Animation 
I got this animation from Spline. I had to customize it to ensure it stays in center and rotates around its axis.

### Navbar and Sidebar
Responsive navbar. On smaller screens, the products and clients (links styled like outline buttons with no border) disappear and the rest of the components are arranged accordingly for great UI on smaller devices. 

On active paths, the buttons have a bottom border. On hover, these buttons change colors (for navbar link and other buttons true throughout the app).

Hamburger menu appears on smaller screens. It opens a sidebar which contains product and clients. One can click outside the sidebar for it to close or click the close button.

### Logo
I created this SVG Logo by myself. I have customized it such that it can invert colors on dark and light mode, but I have decided not to do that as yellow changes to blue.

### Dark/Light Mode
I used a UI Component library called shadcn UI for this component.
